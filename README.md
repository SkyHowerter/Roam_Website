Source code for roam project.
Includes UI design, database, and server/client functions.

Project is part of CSCI 3308 @CU_Boulder

### Project Overview
Roam is a prototype application designed to provide users with personalized vacation recomendations.

The Roam website contains a series of ‘sliders’ in which the user can input their vacation preferences. Then, based on the user's preferences, it recommends a location. 

These sliders get user preferences for-

*Price
*Luxury
*Distance from home
*Average population age
*Touristy vs Off the beaten path. 

If the user wishes to learn more about a country, they can visit the "Learn More" page to view various statistics about that country.


## Running the tests
To view the website, head to the directory where roam is saved in your terminal, and type "node server.js" in the command line.
