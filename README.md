### Project Overview
Roam is a prototype application designed to provide users with personalized vacation recomendations.

The Roam website lets you select on a series of ‘sliders’ what things you’re looking for in a vacation. Then, based on your preferences, it recommends locations, hotels, flights and attractions.
	This application asks the user what they value in a vacation and a trip, as well as their expectations and budget. Then “Roam.” pulls information from Kayak, Google, and Trip Advisor (and other sites like them potentially), and forms a profile “vacation” that the user can up-vote or down-vote certain parts of until they find the vacation they’re interested in. 
	The user selects amongst things like “price”, “luxury-level”, “general location”, “in-country/out-of-country”, “tourist-y vs. off the beaten path”, The application also lets the user bypass any of these sliders if they want to lock-down their vacation into a single country, or a single region. The app is designed to help the user choose a destination, however, and if they already have a small country or city in mind, they probably won’t find the app very helpful.
