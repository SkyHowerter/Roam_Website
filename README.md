### Project Overview
Roam is a prototype application designed to provide users with personalized vacation recomendations.

The Roam website lets you select on a series of ‘sliders’ the things you’re looking for in a vacation. Then, based on your preferences, it recommends a location. These sliders get user preferences for price, luxury, distance from home, average population age, and whether you want to travel somewhere touristy or off the beaten path. If the user wishes to learn more about a country, they can visit the "Learn More" page to view various statistics about that country.
